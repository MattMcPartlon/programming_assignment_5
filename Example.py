For the time period of choice (3000 days), the algorithms perform as follows:

MW1:
num experts : 78
reward : 98.06658172607422
mistakes : 361
percentage of mistakes 61.499148211243615
min of expert mistakes 245.0

MW2:
reward : 103.94658660888672
mistakes : 361
percentage of mistakes 61.499148211243615
min of expert mistakes 245.0

The two algorithms made the exact same number of mistakes over this time period.
However, the second variant achieved a greater reward.

Surprising - pretty nice.
